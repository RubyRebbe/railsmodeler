<h1>Welcome to Rails Modeler</h1>

<div><em>Rails modeler</em> is a tool &mdash; built in ruby on rails &mdash; for visualizing, designing and playing with a rails application without having to generate code.</div>
<div>When you are ready, you can generate your rails app in confidence in one fell swoop. Rails modeler is designed to make building rails applications fun, easier, and less error-prone.</div>

<div>Rails modeler enables you to <strong>manage</strong> (list, create, view, edit, delete):</div>
<ul>
	<li> multiple rails applications </li>
	<li> the model classes within an application </li>
	<li> the attributes of a model class </li>
	<li> the associations between model classes </li>
</ul>

<div>As you incrementally build your rails application, rails modeler will show you:</div>
<ul>
	<li> the rails command which creates your application, including choice of database </li>
	<li> the rails scaffold command for each model class </li>
	<li> the ruby code for each model class, including associations </li>
</ul>
